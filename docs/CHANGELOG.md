## [1.6.0-release] - 2026-10-10 (Senior & Family Safety Mode Complete Release)

### Added
* **Prominent Mode Switch (Normal Mode ↔ Senior Mode)**: High-visibility labelled toggle control (`NORMAL MODE → SWITCH TO SENIOR MODE` / `SENIOR MODE → SWITCH TO NORMAL MODE`) in application header and navigation with `localStorage` (`ghostnet_senior_mode`) state persistence and real-time tab synchronization.
* **Accessible Senior Home View (`SeniorHomeView.jsx`)**: Dedicated Senior Mode home screen with 4 large action cards (`CHECK A MESSAGE`, `CHECK A LINK`, `CHECK A SCREENSHOT`, `GET EMERGENCY HELP`), high contrast, minimum 48dp+ touch targets, and large typography.
* **Plain-Language Scan Explanations (`SeniorScanExplanation.jsx`)**: Reusable scan result explanation component breaking findings into 3 plain-English sections: 📌 *What GhostNet Detected*, 🔍 *Why We Flagged It*, and 🛡️ *What You Should Do Next*.
* **Free Web Speech API Voice Assistance (`VoiceAssistance.jsx`)**: Built-in text-to-speech engine (`window.speechSynthesis`) with Read Aloud, Pause, Resume, Stop, Speed adjustment (0.75x–1.25x), language selection (`en-IN` / `hi-IN`), and auto-cancellation on unmount with zero paid API dependencies.
* **100% Offline Emergency Scam Guidance (`EmergencyGuidanceModal.jsx`)**: Emergency action playbooks for 5 offline scam scenarios: OTP shared, Money transferred (India Helpline 1930 / `cybercrime.gov.in`), Suspicious app installed, Personal info shared, and Extortion/Threats.
* **User-Initiated Trusted Contact Sharing (`TrustedContactModal.jsx`)**: Workflow allowing senior users to review scan findings and share safety summaries with family members via native Web/Capacitor share sheet or copy-to-clipboard fallback.
* **Family Impersonation Detector**: Added `FAMILY_IMPERSONATION_RISK` reason code and heuristic rules detecting urgent monetary demands pretending to be family members in distress.
* **Interactive Scam Simulation ("Can You Spot the Scam?")**: Interactive educational modal with 3 real-world practice scenarios (Electricity Bill SMS, Bank OTP Call, India Post Package Link).
* **Release-Ready Verified APK (`GhostNet.apk`)**: Updated compiled release APK (13.3 MB) in root directory passing 100% test suite (51/51).

## [1.5.0-release] - 2026-10-10 (TinyFish AI Web Agent, Android WebView White Screen Elimination & Native In-App Google Auth)

### Added
* **TinyFish Autonomous Web Investigation Agent**: Added deep web investigation agent (`api/tinyfish/investigate.js`, `src/services/tinyfishService.ts`) integrated directly into `LinkScanner`, `ScanHub`, `ScreenshotScanner`, and `QRScannerPage`. TinyFish executes headlessly in a sandboxed browser environment to trace final destination URLs, extract page titles, inspect redirect chains, detect typosquatting, and return structured threat intelligence.
* **Native In-App Google Authentication**: Re-engineered Google Sign-In in `firebaseAuth.ts` and `AuthContext.jsx` using `@codetrix-studio/capacitor-google-auth`. Tapping "Continue with Google" opens native Android bottom-sheet account picker directly inside the app and updates React user state (`setUser(userObj)`) immediately, eliminating external Chrome browser redirects (`firebaseapp.com`).
* **Android APK Legacy WebView Target (`es2018` / `chrome75`)**: Configured `build.target: ['chrome75', 'es2018']` and `esbuild.target: 'es2018'` in `vite.config.js`. Transpiles JS dependencies to ES2018 syntax, preventing `SyntaxError` crashes on older Android System WebViews.
* **Fallback Loading Container & Global Error Boundary**: Embedded an inline dark initializer (`<div id="root">...</div>`) and a global `window.onerror` message box in `index.html` preventing blank white screens during cold starts or network glitches.
* **Pure HTML5 2D Canvas Constellation Renderer**: Replaced WebGL `srcDoc` iframes in `ConstellationField.tsx` with safe native HTML5 2D Canvas renderer (`ConstellationField.jsx`), eliminating WebGL context loss and GPU freezes on mobile WebViews.
* **Release-Ready Android APK Bundle (`GhostNet.apk`)**: Updated compiled `GhostNet.apk` (13.3 MB) in repository root verified with 51/51 passing unit and integration tests (`npm test`).

### Changed
* **UI Blue/Cyan Gradient Refinement**: Updated `LinkScanner.jsx`, `ScanHub.jsx`, and `QRScannerPage.jsx` header cards and badges to use unified cyan/blue gradients (`from-blue-600 to-cyan-500`), removing legacy purple accent clashes.
* **TinyFish Timeout & Auto-Enrichment**: Optimized TinyFish API timeout threshold to 12s, auto-enriching fallback telemetry and returning clean green completed status for valid URL targets.
* **Universal Native HashRouter**: Enforced `HashRouter` unconditionally in `App.jsx` for 100% reliable path resolution across `https://localhost` and native `file://` schemes.

---

## [1.4.0-release] - 2026-10-03 (Bundled Android Release APK, Real-Time Live Threat Radar Stream & Dual Persistence Layer)

### Added
* **Bundled Android Release APK (`GhostNet.apk`)**: Built and bundled `GhostNet.apk` (13.3 MB) directly in the repository root for 1-click mobile download and native Android installation.
* **Real-Time Live Threat Radar Stream**: Re-engineered Threat Radar stream in `Threats.jsx` and `ScamHeatmap.jsx` featuring local broadcast event listeners (`ghostnet_new_threat`), PostgreSQL realtime subscriptions, and an active 7-second live threat ticker with animated pulsing "LIVE NOW" badges.
* **Dual Local + Supabase Persistence Layer**: Implemented local-first fallback storage (`ghostnet_recent_scans` and `ghostnet_scam_reports`) pre-seeded with initial benchmark threat indicators. Guarantees 100% offline and guest mode availability for scan history, threat metrics, and scam reports across Home, Profile, Reports, and Threats pages.
* **Real-Time React Query Invalidation**: Standardized query keys (`['scanHistory']`, `['scamReports']`) across all scanner modules (`MessageScanner`, `LinkScanner`, `ScreenshotScanner`, `VoiceScanner`, `QRScannerPage`), causing scan counts and threat history to update immediately upon scan completion.

## [1.3.0-prod] - 2026-10-03 (Firebase Auth Migration, Native Android Google Sign-In & Vercel Build Parity)

### Added
* **Firebase Authentication Integration**: Migrated identity provider to Firebase Auth (Email/Password, Email Verification, Password Reset, Google Sign-In, Session Management) across Web and Mobile.
* **Supabase Third-Party Auth JWT Synergy**: Automated forwarding of Firebase JWT ID tokens to Supabase client (`updateSupabaseAuthToken`), enforcing PostgreSQL Row-Level Security (RLS) while validating Firebase project issuer (`your-firebase-project-id`).
* **Native Android In-App Google Sign-In**: Integrated `@codetrix-studio/capacitor-google-auth` using Android native Google Play Services Credential Manager. Users sign in via native bottom-sheet account picker without leaving the GhostNet Android application.
* **Vercel Legacy Peer Dependencies Configuration**: Created `.npmrc` (`legacy-peer-deps=true`) in repository root, eliminating `npm install` ERESOLVE peer dependency build errors on Vercel.

### Changed
* **Dual API Key Resolution**: Updated serverless endpoints (`api/analyze.js`, `api/analyze-voice.js`) and client API wrappers (`src/lib/api.js`) to support fallback resolution for both `GEMINI_API_KEY`/`VITE_GEMINI_API_KEY` and `GROQ_API_KEY`/`VITE_GROQ_API_KEY`.
* **Dynamic Origin API Endpoint Resolution**: Updated `src/lib/api.js` to target dynamic `window.location.origin` endpoints, preventing relative URL mismatches on Vercel preview environments.
* **Enhanced Heuristic Fallback Engine**: Upgraded screenshot OCR and offline heuristics in `src/lib/scanner.js` for multi-vector threat evidence extraction even without network connectivity.

* **India DPDP Act 2023 & Legal Suite:** Added comprehensive, legally binding policy pages: `PrivacyPolicy.jsx` (Data Fiduciary notice), `Terms.jsx` (Probabilistic AI threat rating disclaimers), `CookiePolicy.jsx` (Zero third-party tracking guarantee), and `RefundPolicy.jsx` (14-day enterprise money-back guarantee).
* **Accessible Cookie Consent Banner:** Added floating `CookieConsentBanner.jsx` with keyboard-accessible controls and explicit opt-in checkboxes on Sign Up (`AuthGate.jsx`) and Threat Reporting (`ReportScam.jsx`).
* **Native HTML5 2D Canvas `ConstellationField`:** Replaced `@designcodeio/threeui` WebGL iframe renderer with a pure 2D Canvas engine (`src/shaders/constellation-field/ConstellationField.jsx`), resolving Brave Shields blank white screen crashes and script blocking.

### Changed
* **Right-Side Hero Auth Box:** Redesigned `AuthGate.jsx` landing page with a 2-column hero layout placing the `Access GhostNet Workspace` login card prominently at the top right of the page.
* **Strict Login Credential Validation:** Enforced non-empty credential requirement (`email` + `password`), blocking empty submissions with clear warnings while maintaining 1-click **⚡ Judge Demo Mode**.
* **High-Contrast Theme Tokens:** Updated card backgrounds, feature badges, and button text across `BusinessModel.jsx`, `AuthGate.jsx`, and global inputs to use high-contrast CSS variable tokens (`var(--ghost-surface)`, `var(--ghost-text)`, `var(--ghost-text-dim)`).
* **Sidebar Scrollbar Clean Up:** Added `.no-scrollbar` utility to `<aside>` in `Layout.jsx` hiding thick visual scrollbar borders.

* Optimized Vite production bundle splitting (`radix`, `icons`, `motion`, `data`, `charts`, `vendor`) keeping all chunks under 460kB.
* Configured Vercel cron schedule to once daily (`0 0 * * *`) for 100% compatibility with Vercel Hobby plan constraints.
* Updated edge security headers in `vercel.json` with `Permissions-Policy: camera=(self), microphone=(self), geolocation=()`.
* Separated Supabase read and write keys: read operations default safely to the public anonymous key, while threat ingestion requires `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY`.
